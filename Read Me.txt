Before you run anything make sure "Logistic Regression.py", "pre_process.py", and both test and train folders are in the same directory.

run "pre_process.py" first, this allows us to store our processed data into a npy file. There should be 4 files after running the file.
runtime may very depending on the machine it is run on.

next, run "Logistic Regression" and it will tell you the accuracy of said data given to us.
runtime may very depending on the machine.
